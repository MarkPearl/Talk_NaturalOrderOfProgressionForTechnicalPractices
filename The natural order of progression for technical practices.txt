## Abstract ##
 
Many think Agile is just about stand-ups & sticky notes when it is actually about being able to deliver valuable software quicker. It is impossible to do this if you don't leverage the technical practices agile has embraced. The challenge is - where do you start? Do you focus your energy on understanding TDD, or put time into a continuous build environment. What is the natural order of progression and how do you implement them without slowing down feature delivery?

In this session Mark is going to present what he believes is the natural order of progression of technical practices. He will highlight some of the challenges he's faced with teams trying to increase their release rate and what they did to overcome these barriers.

This talk is appropriate for technical AND non-technical people involved in Software Development who would like to release to production more frequently (be it from Months to Weeks, Weeks to Days, or Days to Hours). Those already hitting the magical continuous release rate don't need to attend ;-)
## How is your topic relevant to an African context ##

While I believe this topic is universal and could have application all over the world, it is also relevant to an African context because the experiences shared have been gained on the African continent. Being a South African having practiced agile in Africa for several years, this will be universal advice with an African flavour based on experience gained with African teams.

## Keywords ##

TDD, 
Automated Deployment, 
Continuous Integration, 
Version Control, 
Automated Testing, 
Deliver Faster

## Learning Outcomes ##
Understand the order of implementing technical practices
Understand why each technical practice is valuable
Understand how long each technical practice usually takes to embrace or see a return on
Debunk potential myths on why one technical practice will solve all your problems

## Pre-requisite Knowledge ##

None

## Bio ##

I've been involved in creating software for over two decades. Most of the time I have gotten it wrong, sometimes I've gotten it right. As I get older it feels like I am getting it right more often. I find nothing more fulfilling than being involved in creating something that has a real impact on other people’s lives.

I love sharing the insights I have gained from these experiences with others - I do this by speaking at events, writing and facilitating workshops.
